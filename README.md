# ML-Data-Classification-Algorithms

The aim is to study experimentally the performance of known Machine Learning algorithms for the problem of classification using the dataset above. The evaluation
performance of the methods will be done according to the following evaluation measures in the control set:
- Accuracy (success rate of the classifier), 𝐴𝐶𝐶 = (𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁)/(𝑃 + 𝑁)
- F1 score, 𝐹1 = 2(𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 ∗ 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙)/(𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙)

𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑇𝑃/(𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃), 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑇𝑃/(𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹N)

#### For the purposes of this project we are studing the following classification methods:
- k-NN Nearest Neighbor with Euclidean distance
- Neural Networks with sigmoid activation function
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naïve Bayes classifier
